Roger David Casement  was an Irish diplomat honoured in 1905 for the Casement Report on the Congo and knighted for his humanitarian work by the British government in 1911 for his important investigations of human rights abuses in Peru. A humanitarian activist, Irish nationalist, and poet. Described as the "father of twentieth-century human rights investigations". <br />He then made efforts during World War I to gain German military aid for the 1916 Easter Rising that sought to gain Irish independence.In spite of his successes fighting for human rights, Casement was later stripped of his knighthood and sentenced to death for his role in the Irish rebellion.

           				<p class="timeline-text" id="text-home">Roger Casement was born Born in Sandycove, Dublin, in 1864 . Son of  a Protestant father and Catholic mother. Orphaned at 13 he was then largely brought up by his paternal relatives the Young family of Galgorm Castle in Antrim. After  to Liverpool at the age of 16, following in his grandfather’s footsteps by working in the shipping industry.
                            <br/>
                        His father, Captain Roger Casement of the (King’s Own) Regiment of Dragoons, was the son of a bankrupt Belfast shipping merchant, Hugh Casement, who later moved to Australia. Captain Casement had served in the 1842 Afghan campaign. He travelled to Europe to fight as a volunteer in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 but arrived after the Surrender at Világos. After the family moved to England, Roger's mother, Anne Jephson (or Jepson), of a Dublin Anglican family, purportedly had him secretly baptised at the age of three as a Roman Catholic in Rhyl, Wales.(font: Wikipedia)

           				<p class="timeline-text" id="text-home">In 1895, Casement began working for the British consular service, and though he was initially pro-colonisation, he became critical of the conditions under  Kings Léopold of Belgium after discovering rampant exploitation taking place at Congolese rubber plantations.
                            <br/>
                        He reported that workers were being ‘motivated’ with guns, chains and whips, while profits for the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company soared. (font: Wikipedia)

           				<p class="timeline-text" id="text-home">Casement travelled for weeks in the upper Congo Basin to interview people throughout the region, including workers, overseers, and mercenaries. He delivered a long, detailed eyewitness report to the Crown that exposed abuses: <em>"the enslavement, mutilation, and torture of natives on the rubber plantations,"</em> becoming known as the Casement Report of 1904. King Leopold had held the Congo Free State since 1885, when the Berlin Conference of European powers and the United States effectively gave him free rein in the area.
				           <br />		
				        When the report was made public, opponents of Congolese conditions formed interest groups, such as the Congo Reform Association, founded by E. D. Morel with Casement's support, and demanded action to relieve the situation of the Congolese. Other European nations followed suit, as did the United States, and the British Parliament demanded a meeting of the 14 signatory powers to review the 1885 Berlin Agreement defining interests in Africa. The Belgian Parliament, pushed by Socialist leader Emile Vandervelde and other critics of the king's Congolese policy, forced Léopold to set up an independent commission of inquiry. In 1905, despite Léopold's efforts, it confirmed the essentials of Casement's report. (font: Wikipedia)

           				<p class="timeline-text" id="text-home">In 1906 the Foreign Office sent Casement to Brazil: first as consul in Santos, then transferred to Pará, and lastly promoted to consul-general in Rio de Janeiro. He was attached as a consular representative to a commission investigating rubber slavery by the Peruvian Amazon Company (PAC), which had a British board of directors and numerous stockholders
				            <br />
				        PAC, with its operational headquarters in Iquitos, dominated the city and the region. The area was separated from the main population of Peru by the Andes, and it was 1900 miles from the Amazon's mouth at Pará. The British-registered company was effectively controlled by the archetypal rubber baron Julio Cesar Arana and his brother. Born in Lima, Arana had climbed out of poverty to own and operate a company harvesting great quantities of rubber in the Peruvian Amazon, which was much in demand on the world market. The rubber boom had led to expansion in Iquitos as a trading center, as all the company rubber was shipped down the Amazon River from there to the Atlantic port. Numerous foreigners had flocked to the area seeking their fortunes in the rubber boom, or at least some piece of the business. The rough frontier city, both respectable businesses and the vice district, was highly dependent on the PAC. (font: Wikipedia)

           				<p class="timeline-text" id="text-home">In a report to the British foreign secretary, dated 17 March 1911, Casement detailed the rubber company's continued use of pillories to punish the Indians: <em>
                        "Men, women, and children were confined in them for days, weeks, and often months... Whole families ... were imprisoned — fathers, mothers, and children, and many cases were reported of parents dying thus, either from starvation or from wounds caused by flogging, while their offspring were attached alongside of them to watch in misery themselves the dying agonies of their parents." (Roger Casement 1911)</em><br />
				        Casement traveled to the Putumayo District, where the rubber was harvested deep in the Amazon Basin, and explored the treatment of the local Indians of Peru. The isolated area was outside the reach of the national government and near the border with Colombia, which periodically made incursions in competition for the rubber. For years, the Indians had been forced into unpaid labor by field staff of the PAC, who exerted absolute power over them and subjected them to near starvation, severe physical abuse, rape of women and girls by the managers and overseers, branding and casual murder. Casement found conditions as inhumane as those in the Congo. He interviewed both the Putumayo and men who had abused them, including three Barbadians who had also suffered from conditions of the company. When the report was publicised, there was public outrage in Britain over the abuses.<br/>
                   
Casement made two lengthy visits to the region, first in 1910 with a commission of investigators.
Casement's report has been described as a "brilliant piece of journalism", as he wove together first-person accounts by both "victims and perpetrators of atrocities ... Never before had distant colonial subjects been given such personal voices in an official document." After his report was made to the British government, some wealthy board members of the PAC were horrified by what they learned. Arana and the Peruvian government promised to make changes. In 1911, the British government asked Casement to return to Iquitos and Putumayo to see if promised changes in treatment had occurred.
In 1911, Casement was knighted by King George V as Knight Bachelor for his efforts on behalf of the Amazonian Indians, before he retired from the British consular service in the Summer of 1913.

           				<p class="timeline-text" id="text-home">After helping to form the Irish Volunteers. He and Eoin MacNeill, later the organisation's chief of staff, co-wrote the Volunteers' manifesto in 1913. In July 1914, as World War 1 was beginning, Casement traveled to the USA to promote and raise money for the Volunteers. While there he established connections with exiled Irish nationalists, particularly Clan na nGael and counted John Devoy amongst his supporters. In September of 1914, in the light of the difficulties Britain was now facing in the war against Germany, Casement set out to gain support from Germany in the fight for Ireland’s independence. A paper, written by Casement, was transmitted from the German Embassy to Berlin arguing that the British could be undermined in vulnerable positions such as Egypt, India and Ireland. Casement urged the Germans to make a declaration in favour of Irish independence. He persuaded the leaders of Clan na nGael to support a mission to Germany, both politically and financially and he set sail in October 1914. <br />
                         <!-- MORE CONTENT    
On 27 December 1914 Casement signed an agreement in Berlin to this effect with Arthur Zimmermann in the German Foreign Office. Fifty-two of the 2000 prisoners volunteered for the Brigade. Contrary to German promises, they received no training in the use of machine guns, which at the time were relatively new and unfamiliar weapons.  The German weapons never landed in Ireland; the Royal Navy intercepted the ship transporting them, a German cargo vessel named the Libau, disguised as a Norwegian vessel, Aud-Norge. The British had intercepted German communications coming from Washington and suspected that there was going to be an attempt to land arms at Ireland.
Meanwhile, Roger Casement had followed the ship in a German submarine, and planned to meet it in Kerry. On the 21st April, he was put ashore at Banna Strand in Tralee Bay and was quickly captured and arrested by British troops. He was taken to England where he was imprisoned in the Tower of London and Brixton as he awaited trial.

           				<p class="timeline-text" id="text-home">Casement was hanged at Pentonville Prison in London on 3 August 1916. He was 51 years old.Before and during the trial and appeal, the British government secretly circulated alleged excerpts of Casement's journals in a campaign to portray Casement as a sexual deviant, including numerous explicit accounts of sexual activity. It tried to arouse opinions against him and to influence those notables who might otherwise have tried to intervene. Given societal views and the illegality of homosexuality at the time, support for Casement declined in some quarters. The journals became known as the Black Diaries.<br/>
                        The Black Diaries are a set of diaries claimed by British officials to have been written by Casement and covering the years 1903, 1910 and 1911 (twice). Jeffrey Dudgeon, who has published an edition of all the diaries said,<em>"His homosexual life was almost entirely out of sight and disconnected from his career and political work"</em>. If genuine, the diaries reveal Casement as a homosexual who had many partners, had a fondness for young men and mostly paid for sex.<br />
                            <!-- MORE CONTENT 
In 1916 after Casement's conviction for treason, the British government circulated alleged photographs of pages of the diary to individuals who were urging commutation of Casement's death sentence. At a time of strong conservatism, not least among Irish Catholics, publicising the Black Diaries and his alleged homosexuality undermined support for Casement. The question of whether the diaries are genuine or forgeries has been much debated. The diaries were declassified for limited inspection (by persons approved by the Home Office) in August 1959. The original diaries may be seen at the British National Archives in Kew. Historians and biographers of Casement's life have taken opposing views. Roger McHugh (in 1976) and Angus Mitchell (in 2000 and later) have argued that the diaries were forged. In 2012, Mitchell published several articles in the Field Day Review of Notre Dame University.

           				<p class="timeline-text" id="text-home">Casement's body was buried in quicklime in the prison cemetery at the rear of Pentonville Prison, where he was hanged. During the decades after his execution, many formal requests for repatriation of Casement's remains were refused by British Governments. Finally, in 1965 Casement's remains were repatriated to the Republic of Ireland. Despite the annulment/withdrawal of his knighthood in 1916, the 1965 UK Cabinet record of the repatriation decision refers to him as Sir Roger Casement.<br/> Casement's last wish was to be buried at Murlough Bay on the north coast of County Antrim. Prime Minister Harold Wilson's government had released the remains only on condition that they could not be brought into Northern Ireland, as <em>"the government feared that a reburial there could provoke Catholic celebrations and Protestant reactions."</em> <br/>
                            <!-- MORE CONTENT
Casement's remains lay in state at Arbour Hill in Dublin for five days, during which time an estimated half a million people filed past his coffin. After a state funeral, the remains were buried with full military honours in the Republican plot in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin, with other Irish republicans and nationalists. The President of Ireland, Éamon de Valera, who in his mid-eighties was the last surviving leader of the Easter Rising attended the ceremony, along with an estimated 30,000 others.

									Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
